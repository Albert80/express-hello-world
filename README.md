# express-hello-world
First close up to Express framework
***
**You need to install express.js and node-dev**

### Getting ready...

Install express.js

Go to terminal and write `npm i express -E`

Then you will need to install 'node-dev' just type `npm i node-dev -ED`

> It is very important flags `-E` or `bash --save-exact`
> it means that saved dependencies will be configured with an
> exact version rather than using npm's default semver
> range operator; `-D`or `--save-dev` this means that 
> your package will appear in your devDependencies
